Dear friends, I'd like you to spare a moment to please consider the tragedy that has touched and affected a friend and colleague of mine just a few weeks ago.

I want you to meet Christian - who's been working with me from the Philippines for the past year or so. We use skype to chat and get work done. He's been an amazing worker.


<img style="height: 100%; width:100%; margin: 10px;" src="images/destruction.jpg">





Christian has largely relied on a monthly wage from me. He's been saving money to help provide for his Filipino family, including renovating the family home. Builders have drilled with a rat-tat-tat-tat-tat sound in the background while we tried to put our heads together and work out how to list more products on eBay. He's been the main breadwinner for his family which includes his mother, father, sister and niece.

This week I casually typed a message on skype and asked how he was doing.

What he told me next completely shocked me, and left a sinking feeling in my heart...
</p>

<p>

On 15 October 2013, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Philippines. The epicentre was the island of Bohol - where Christian lives.

It had an estimated strength of 32 Hiroshima atomic bombs.

It was early morning. Christian's whole family was home, inside, when the earthquake struck. The force was so strong it completely leveled their home, made from concrete.

Christian's sister and her daughter (his niece) were horrifically injured in the Earthquake.

In a frantic effort Christian picked up his sister and carried her to hospital in his bare hands while his mum carried his niece. There were no ambulances. There was chaos everywhere.

The hospital were unable to do anything. Tragically both of them passed away a very short time later. </p>

<p>

<b>Christian's home has been completely destroyed. His family have no home whatsoever.</b> </p>
<p> Over 270,000 Bohol residents are homeless living under tarpaulins and makeshift shelter. Christian and his family are among them.
</p>

<p>
It gets worse...
</p>
<p>

<p>
Yesterday, Friday 8 November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines.
</p>
<p>
(Hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons are the same thing. They are just called different names in different parts of the world).
</p>
<p>
Winds up to 320km per hour have been recorded. <b>It has been described as one of the world's strongest storms in recorded history</b>. We haven't been able to contact Christian since and are hoping for the best. We'll update this page when we know more.
</p>

<p>
An average wage in the Philippines is USD$200 a month. Christian is well educated and in a good month of full-time work Christian could make USD$1200. He's reliant on working remotely to earn an income. With power outages, disrupted internet and no where to live I have no idea how long it will take him to regain his feet. Christian is extremely humble, like many Filipinos. 
</p>
<p>
He would never ask for a handout or assistance. It's pretty clear to me the Filipino people are in serious trouble and I know we can help.

</p>
<p>
If this story has touched you and you'd like to make a difference, you can donate to unicef to help those in affected areas. These are Christian's wishes for donations to go to those in the most affected areas.

</p>
<p>
I'll be keeping this page updated and will post on Facebook. The photo on this page is not of Christian's family - I don't have any except for his Skype ID image. Once his internet is up and running I'll hopefully put up some photos of Christian and his family.
</p>
